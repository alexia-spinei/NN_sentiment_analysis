# NN_sentiment_analysis

We are aiming to create a feedforward neural network that can perform a sentiment analysis and classify tweets/reviews 
as being positive or negative. For this we will use a bag of words approach. We will collect the data, preprocess it by
removing punctuation or non-alphabetical characters and splitting it into words (tokens), and divide it into the training
and the test sets. We will then train and test our model using cross-validation.
